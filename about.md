## Who I Am

I am Vyrnexis: Linux user, hobbyist coder, and repeat offender of "just one more refactor before bed."

Most of what I build starts as a practical itch, then accidentally becomes a full project.

## Origin Story (Condensed)

- Started with VB6.
- Got deeper with Delphi.
- Spent time in C# and Python.
- Landed on Nim and stayed there for speed, clarity, and sane binaries.

I also spent years reverse engineering, writing keygens, and built a Delphi DirectX9 menu hack for Combat Arms.

## What I Build

- Linux-first utilities and scripts
- Terminal tools and launchers
- Cinnamon and Budgie desktop applets
- Projects that automate repetitive setup pain

## Projects You Will See A Lot

- **NimLaunch**: keyboard-first launcher workflows
- **Nymph**: lightweight fetch utility in Nim
- **Sensibo applets**: climate controls for Cinnamon/Budgie panels
- **Niri-install**: scripted desktop bootstrap
- **BytePatcher / Pasfetch**: lower-level utility experiments

## About This Site

It is not a downloaded blog template with a logo swap.

## What To Expect Here

- build logs
- code snippets
- project post-mortems
- practical Linux notes
- occasional humor when something breaks in a funny way

## Current Focus

- ship better Linux tools
- document real workflows instead of theory
- turn project work into useful YouTube content
