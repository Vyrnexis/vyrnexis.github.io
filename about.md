## About Vyrnexis

I’m Vyrnexis, a builder and writer who enjoys minimal, dark tech aesthetics. This site is where I share notes on development, design experiments, and the occasional deep dive into tools I love.

## What You’ll Find

- Build notes on web and systems projects
- UI/UX experiments with dark, minimal styling
- Short takes on productivity and developer tooling
- Links to projects and prototypes

## Current Focus

- Refining a cohesive dark theme across apps
- Automating small workflows that save time every day
- Exploring design systems that balance clarity and personality

Thanks for stopping by. If you’re into minimal, purposeful design with a tech edge, you’re in the right place.
