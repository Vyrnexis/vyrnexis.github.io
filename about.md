## About Vyrnexis

I’m Vyrnexis—a Linux-first tinkerer who writes code for fun. This blog is my scratchpad for experiments, notes, and the occasional deep dive.

## Journey

- Started out hacking on VB6, slid into Delphi, touched C# and Python, and these days enjoy Nim for its speed and clarity.
- Spent time reverse engineering and even built a DirectX overlay/menu for Combat Arms back in the day.
- Still happiest when exploring how things work under the hood.

## What I’m Into Now

- Linux workflows, dotfiles, and lightweight setups.
- Building small tools and prototypes.
- Sharing tutorials and breakdowns—YouTube content on Linux and programming is on the roadmap.

## Projects You’ll See Here

- NimLaunch — a launcher/utility suite in Nim.
- Nymph — ongoing tooling experiments.
- Desktop applets (e.g., Sensibo Monitor) for Cinnamon and Budgie.

## Tech Stack Highlights

- Nim, Python, bits of C#, and a soft spot for Delphi nostalgia.
- Graphics/overlay tinkering and reverse engineering curiosities.
