This is the first post on the **Vyrnexis** Jekyll-powered blog.

You can write posts in Markdown, commit them to the `_posts` folder, and GitHub Pages will automatically rebuild the site.

```bash
# Example commands
git add _posts/2025-12-04-welcome-to-vyrnexis.md
git commit -m "Add first post"
git push
```

That's it — no manual HTML editing needed for new posts.
